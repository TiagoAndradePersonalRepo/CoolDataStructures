## Graph ##

In this implmentation of Graph a dict was used to store the information for the eges and vertexes. Methods like __insertNode()__, __removeNode()__ and __shortestPath()__ were implemented. The edge value though commonly used with __number__ types can be used with ANY object that is "Addable". That is it allows __x.\_\_add\_\_(y)__ to be used.
